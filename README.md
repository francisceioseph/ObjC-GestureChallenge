# ObjC-GestureChallenge
A simple app that shows how to use some gesture recognizers like SingleTap, DoubleTap and LongPress

## The Project
This is a simple exercise that I did when I was learning Objective-C, so I decided to share this knowledge.

The ViewController.m file contains the implementation of the desired behavior of a red square when the user tap, double-tap or long press the device screen. I think it explains well how this action gestures works. 

## Features

* Long press to change square color randomly.
* Simple tap to move the square fastly to the tapped point on the screen
* Double tap to move the square slowly to the tapped point on the screen

## Main Knowleadges
* Some iOS Gesture Recognizers

## Tecnologies

* iOS 8.1 +
* Objective-C
